## U-Net-Image-Segmentation

This is an image segmentation using U-Net architecture implemented via PyTorch. 
Essentially, this process consists of down-sampling and up-sampling, where each procedure contains 2 convolutional layers with 2 activation functions. 

This is the final image segmentation results tested on Carvana images from Kaggle: "https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge"

The U-Net architecture is solely based on the authors of:
