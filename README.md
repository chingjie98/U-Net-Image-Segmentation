## U-Net-Image-Segmentation

This is an image segmentation using U-Net architecture implemented via PyTorch. 
Essentially, this process consists of down-sampling and up-sampling, where each procedure contains 2 convolutional layers with 2 activation functions. 

This is the final image segmentation results tested on Carnava images from Kaggle.
